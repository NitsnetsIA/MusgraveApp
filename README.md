# Musgrave Purchase Order Management System

A mobile-first offline React SPA for Musgrave's purchase order management system, designed to streamline Spanish grocery business workflows with advanced order processing capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd MusgraveApp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:5555` (or the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable).

### Production Build
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

This creates a production build in the `dist/public/` directory.

### Local Deployment Testing
```bash
# Build the application first
npm run build

# Prepare for static deployment
node scripts/deploy-prepare.js

# Start local server to test the built application
npm start
```

The prepared files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

### Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Prepare for static deployment
node scripts/deploy-prepare.js
```

**Deployment Output:**
- **Source files**: `dist/public/` (React app built files)
- **Server files**: `dist/index.js` (Express server for local testing)
- **Static files**: `dist/` (ready for hosting platforms like Replit, Vercel, Netlify)

**Note**: The `scripts/deploy-prepare.js` script automatically:
- Moves built files to the correct locations
- Creates SPA routing configuration
- Generates necessary deployment files

## üì¶ Deployment

This application is configured for **static deployment** on Replit. The deployment process:

1. **Build**: Vite compiles the React app to `dist/public/`
2. **Prepare**: Deployment script moves files to `dist/` and creates SPA routing configuration
3. **Deploy**: Static files are served from `dist/` with proper SPA routing support

### Deployment Files
- `scripts/deploy-prepare.js` - Automated deployment preparation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide
